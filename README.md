What comes after the reaction? The explosion!

## What is this?

I wanted to challenge myself. So I thought:

> Why not try to build [React](https://reactjs.org) from scratch?

But I don't want to copy some existing stuff. Well, let's say not completely. For sure I will copy big parts of the API design. What I want to avoid completely are classes. I want to build my version of React that ONLY works with hooks.

## TFD (Time for development)

For good measure I am developing next to a timer when I work on this. I want to measure how fast I can go.

Here is the total time I spent on this:

| **Total**  | **1h 5min** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 2019-04-11 | 1h 5min     |
